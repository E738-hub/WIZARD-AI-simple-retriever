
Bacteria are microscopic, mostly single-celled organisms that make up a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. They are found almost everywhere on Earth, including soil, water, acidic hot springs, and deep within the Earth's crust. Bacteria play crucial roles in nutrient cycles, such as recycling nutrients, nitrogen fixation, and decomposition of organic matter. Some bacteria convert compounds like hydrogen sulfide and methane into energy, supporting life in extreme environments like hydrothermal vents.

Bacteria exist in various relationships with plants and animals, including mutualistic, commensal, and parasitic interactions. Humans host vast numbers of bacteria, mainly in the gut, where most are harmless or beneficial. However, some bacteria are pathogenic and cause diseases like cholera, tuberculosis, and leprosy. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, but antibiotic resistance is a growing concern. Bacteria are also important in industries, such as sewage treatment, fermentation in food production, biomining, biotechnology, and chemical manufacturing.

Bacteria are classified as prokaryotes, lacking a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Previously considered plants, bacteria are now understood as distinct from eukaryotes and are classified into two domains: Bacteria and Archaea. The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology.
